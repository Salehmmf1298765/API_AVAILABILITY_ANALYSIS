## 3) Effort estimation (Hours)

### Phase 1 (Core Mobile API + eCommerce)

| Workstream | Estimate (Hours) | Days @ 8h/day | Weeks @ 5d/week |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| API base + authentication strategy | 24-40 | 3-5 | 0.6-1.0 |

| Payments integration (incl. MyFatoorah mapping to mobile contract) | 24-40 | 3-5 | 0.6-1.0 |
| Loyalty/promotions/wallet (as per CSV contract) | 32-50 | 4-6.25 | 0.8-1.25 |

| Reviews | 12-20 | 1.5-2.5 | 0.3-0.5 |
| CMS + system config/flags | 16-24 | 2-3 | 0.4-0.6 |
| Support tickets (helpdesk) | 16-24 | 2-3 | 0.4-0.6 |
| QA + test cycles + handover | 24-40 | 3-5 | 0.6-1.0 |
| **Phase 1 Total** | **216-342** | **27-43** | **5.4-8.6** |

### Phase 2 (Advanced Logistics + Driver + Analytics)

| Workstream | Estimate (Hours) | Days @ 8h/day | Weeks @ 5d/week |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Delivery zones/ETA/slots/live tracking (integration-dependent) | 40-80 | 5-10 | 1.0-2.0 |
| Driver app endpoints + driver order status workflow | 40-80 | 5-10 | 1.0-2.0 |
| Loyalty tier + referral (if required by app) | 16-24 | 2-3 | 0.4-0.6 |
| Returns + confirm delivery flows | 16-24 | 2-3 | 0.4-0.6 |
| Analytics API endpoints (aggregation + access rules) | 24-40 | 3-5 | 0.6-1.0 |
| QA + performance + security hardening | 16-24 | 2-3 | 0.4-0.6 |
| **Phase 2 Total** | **152-272** | **19-34** | **3.8-6.8** |

### Overall total (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

| Total | Hours | Days @ 8h/day | Weeks @ 5d/week |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Overall Total** | **368-614** | **46-77** | **9.2-15.4** |

### Assumptions (for estimation)

- REST endpoints are implemented as Odoo HTTP controllers returning JSON.
- Access control and record rules are enforced per endpoint.
- External logistics/live tracking integration is treated as a separate dependency impacting Phase 2.

### Benchmark reference (web)

- A common rule-of-thumb for a *first* Odoo integration (including learning curve) is **~20-40 hours**, and subsequent similar integrations tend to be faster once patterns are established.
